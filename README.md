# Neural-Networks-for-Recognition

<p align="justify"> Using hand-coded (python) and PyTorch-based Neural Networks (and auto-encoders) for recognition of flowers, digits and alphabets. <br> <br> This is a part of the work I have done during my Masters at Carnegie Mellon University. The Problem Statement is from a course -> (16-720B) Computer Vision. Results were achieved under the guidance of Prof. Deva Kannan Ramanan and his Teaching Assistants. <br> <br> The zip folder has the important parts of the assignment, including all the theory and the code. Please do not plagiarize if you're taking the course. </p>
